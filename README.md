# Cardigan.js
Cardigan.js is a Javascript library that targets the browser.

It provides client-side functionality required to integrate Cardigan into the front end of a Shopify store.

You can learn more about Cardigan at https://docs.runcardigan.com.

## Theme integration
Integrating Cardigan with your Shopify theme allows customers to check the balance of their gift cards as well as purchase new cards from a gift card product page.

Cardigan offers two paths for theme integration: drag-and-drop widgets via theme app extensions, and fully custom builds using our client library.

### Drag and drop widgets
If you're using Cardigan's drag and drop widgets, you won't need to use this library directly as the widgets automatically load Cardigan.js from the Cardigan CDN and call it as needed.

Learn more about [drag and drop widgets](https://docs.runcardigan.com/introduction/theme-integration#drag-and-drop-widgets) and how to use them from the docs.

### Custom theme integration
If you want complete control over how Cardigan is integrated into your Shopify theme, or you're building a headless solution, you'll likely be using this library.

How you do that depends on your preferred integration and development method - you can either load the compiled library from the Cardigan CDN, or you can import Cardigan as an ES6 module.

Some high-level information on each of these approaches is provided below, and you can learn [more about custom theme integration](https://docs.runcardigan.com/introduction/theme-integration#custom-theme-integration) from the docs.

#### From the Cardigan CDN
The Cardigan CDN is a performant, edge-cached delivery system that makes all current and historical versions of the Cardigan.js library available directly to the browser.

The latest version of the library is `1.2.0`, which can be loaded and initialised on required pages like this:

```liquid
<script id="cardigan-config" type="application/json">
  {
    "endpoint": "https://app.runcardigan.com/api/v1",
    "subdomain": "example"
  }
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.runcardigan.com/cardigan-js/1.2.0/cardigan.js"></script>
```

The required configuration options to be provided in the `cardigan-config` element are:

* `endpoint`: The Cardigan API endpoint to make requests to; this will almost always be `https://app.runcardigan.com/api/v1` unless you've been provided a specific staging environment URL by the Cardigan team;
* `subdomain`: The Shopify subdomain for your store; the subdomain is the prefix preceding `.myshopify.com` in your store URL.

#### As an ES6 Module
If you have an existing ES6-based build process for your front end, you can add Cardigan.js as a dependency with NPM:

```shell
npm install runcardigan/cardigan-js#1.2.0
```

or Yarn:

```shell
yarn add runcardigan/cardigan-js#1.2.0
```

You can then import the `Cardigan` class and initialise it with the same configuration options as described above:

```js
// import Cardigan library
import { Cardigan } from "cardigan-js";

// initialise Cardigan instance with configuration options
const cardigan = new Cardigan(
  document,
  window.Shopify,
  {
    "endpoint": "https://app.runcardigan.com/api/v1",
    "subdomain": "example"
  }
);

// use the Cardigan API object directly
cardigan.api.getCardBalance({ number: '84142498040559305028', pin: '8521 '});
```

## Reference
This section describes each of the API methods available via the client, their method signature, and an example usage.

### Get card balance
Get the balance of the given card and PIN combination.

```js
cardigan.api.getCardBalance({
  number: '84142498040559305028',
  pin: '8521',
  onSuccess: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call succeeds, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "card": {
    //     "currency": "CAD",
    //     "balance": "100.00",
    //     "balance_formatted": "$100.00",
    //     "expires_at": null
    //   }
    // }
  },
  onError: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call fails, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "errors": [
    //     {
    //       "code": "card_not_found",
    //       "description": "Could not find a card with the provided details."
    //     }
    //   ]
    // }
  },
  onComplete: () => {
    // this method will always run regardless of the result
  }
});
```

### Get rewards balance
Get the rewards balance for the given customer.

This is an authenticated endpoint; when calling it, the Cardigan.js library will automatically request a customer session token for the logged in customer.

```js
cardigan.api.getRewardsBalance({
  id: '487348390022',
  onSuccess: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call succeeds, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "rewards": {
    //     "currency": "CAD",
    //     "balance": "100.00",
    //     "balance_formatted": "$100.00"
    //   }
    // }
  },
  onError: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call fails, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "errors": [
    //     {
    //       "code": "customer_not_found",
    //       "description": "Could not find customer account."
    //     }
    //   ]
    // }
  },
  onComplete: () => {
    // this method will always run regardless of the result
  }
});
```

### Apply gift card
Validate the balance of a gift card and ensure a corresponding Shopify gift card is present, so that it can be applied to the Shopify checkout if required.

It's rare that you will need to call this endpoint unless you're developing your own custom checkout integration with Cardigan.

```js
cardigan.api.applyCard({
  number: '84142498040559305028',
  pin: '8521',
  onSuccess: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call succeeds, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "card": {
    //     "id": "018607f9-ce90-420f-cd2e-365a14515365",
    //     "code": "2402476c03f20e567890",
    //     "currency": "CAD",
    //     "balance": "100.00"
    //   }
    // }
  },
  onError: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call fails, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "errors": [
    //     {
    //       "code": "invalid_pin",
    //       "description": "Provided PIN is invalid."
    //     }
    //   ]
    // }
  },
  onComplete: () => {
    // this method will always run regardless of the result
  }
});
```

### Apply rewards balance
Validate the balance of a customerâ€™s reward account and ensure a corresponding Shopify gift card is present, so that it can be applied to the Shopify checkout if required.

It's rare that you will need to call this endpoint unless you're developing your own custom checkout integration with Cardigan.

This is an authenticated endpoint; when calling it, the Cardigan.js library will automatically request a customer session token for the logged in customer.

```js
cardigan.api.applyRewards({
  id: '487348390022',
  amount: '25.00',
  onSuccess: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call succeeds, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "reward": {
    //     "id": "018607f9-ce90-420f-cd2e-365a14515365",
    //     "code": "2402476c03f20e56RWRD",
    //     "currency": "CAD",
    //     "balance": "100.00",
    //     "amount": "75.00"
    //   }
    // }
  },
  onError: (result) => {
    // this method will run if the API call fails, with `result` populated as:
    // {
    //   "errors": [
    //     {
    //       "code": "unauthorized",
    //       "description": "Unauthorized."
    //     }
    //   ]
    // }
  },
  onComplete: () => {
    // this method will always run regardless of the result
  }
});
```
